# Make Me Awesome README

Welcome to the Make Me Awesome README! Here, you'll find instructions on how to make your development environment as awesome as mine (well, almost!).

Before diving in, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Operating System:**
   - Ensure you're using a Debian-based OS. While other distributions might work, the instructions provided are tailored for Debian-based systems.

2. **Preparation:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the basics of how your operating system works. A little knowledge can go a long way in troubleshooting and customizing your setup.

3. **Tool Installation:**
   - Install the tools mentioned in this README, such as LunarVim and Regolith, following their respective documentation. Don't worry; I believe in you! You've got this.

4. **Customization:**
   - You have the option to run the `makemeawesome.sh` script provided. This script will replace your existing configurations for LunarVim, Zshrc, and Regolith with my preferred settings. However, feel free to skip this step if you're comfortable with your current configurations or prefer to customize them over time.

Now, let's get started:

1. **Install Tools:**
   - Follow the documentation of each tool mentioned in the README to install them on your system.
    - [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
    - [Zap ZSH](https://www.zapzsh.com/)
    - [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)
    - [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) 
    - [Regolith](https://regolith-desktop.org/)

2. **Run `makemeawesome.sh`:**
   - Once you've installed the necessary tools, navigate to the directory containing `makemeawesome.sh`.
   - Run the script using the following command:
    - grant executable permission 
        ```chmod +x ./makemeawesome.sh```
     ```bash
     ./makemeawesome.sh
     ```
   - This script will replace your LunarVim, Zshrc, and Regolith configurations with my preferred settings. If you're not ready for this level of commitment, feel free to skip this step and keep your default configurations.

3. **Enjoy the Awesomeness:**
   - With everything set up according to my preferences, you're ready to dive into coding awesomeness! Whether you're slinging code or exploring new projects, may your development journey be filled with productivity and joy.

4. **Further Customization:**
   - Feel free to tweak and adjust the configurations to better suit your needs and preferences. After all, customization is key to creating a truly personalized development environment.

That's it! You're now equipped with the tools and configurations to make your development environment awesome. Happy coding! ðŸš€
