# Developer README

Welcome to my developer README! Here you'll find information about the tools and setups I use for my development environment. 

## What does a developer need?

Well, apart from copious amounts of caffeine and a solid internet connection, here's the essentials:

1. **Operating System (OS):** I'm currently rocking Debian Bookworm. But hey, any Debian-based distro like Ubuntu or Pop!_OS works just fine. Choose your flavor, just like you choose your ice cream!

2. **Terminal:** The gateway to the digital universe. I've recently fallen for Wezterm. Rust, because why not add a little flavor to your terminal, right? But let's be honest, default terminals with a fancy zsh config are like old faithfuls – reliable and comforting, like a warm blanket on a cold coding night.

3. **IDE (or PDE – Personal Development Environment, as I like to call it):** Neovim is my jam, and LunarVim is the sweet jelly that makes it even better. It's like having a personal butler for your coding needs. Because who has time to set up their Neovim config from scratch? We've got code to write and memes to browse!

4. **Git:** Lazygit. Because if there's one thing developers excel at, it's being lazy efficient. Once you go lazy with your Git, you'll never go back. And yes, I know, the joke's as lame as a broken pointer, but hey, it's the little things that keep us going in the midst of code chaos.

## Linux Distribution and Window Managers

As for Linux distributions, Debian Bookworm is my current flavor of choice. But don't feel limited – Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, or any Debian-based distro will do the trick. 

And about window managers, I've danced with Gnome, flirted with Sway, and had a brief affair with i3. But then, i3 autoconfigured from Regolith swooped in like a knight in shining armor, solving almost all of my life problems. It's like finding that perfect pair of coding socks – snug, efficient, and oddly satisfying.

I'll keep adding more tools to this list as I stumble upon them in my never-ending quest for developer productivity and seamless workflow. So stay tuned, fellow coders!
