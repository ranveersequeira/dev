# ~/.aerospace.toml - Modified for a Regolith i3-like experience
#
# Key changes:
# - The primary modifier key is now 'option' (to act as the 'super' key)
# - alt-enter opens a new terminal instance
# - alt-b opens a new Google Chrome instance
# - Gaps are enabled for a more traditional tiling look
# - Important macOS shortcut conflicts are addressed (see notes below)
